\section{Phages}

In this chapter we will present some known facts about phages, which will be the central topic of our work. We will
describe phage morphology, life cycle and their role in environment. We will also point out their potential use for
mankind.

\section{What are phages}
Phages are viruses which are capable of infecting bacterial cells. They are also the most abundant species on earth
with estimate count around $10^{31}$. That is 10 times more than the number of all bacteria on earth. Thanks to this
high abundance, their impact for circulating of carbon is very significant.
